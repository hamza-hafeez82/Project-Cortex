## Overview

**Project Cortex** is a biologically inspired cognitive architecture designed to model the executive functions of the human prefrontal cortex. The system integrates multiple specialized cognitive agents, a central Orchestrator, structured shared memory, and multi-layer safety arbitration to support autonomous reasoning, hierarchical planning, long-horizon decision making, and adaptive learning.

This repository contains:

- Research papers and conceptual documentation  
- High-level algorithms and pseudocode  
- Architectural diagrams (coming soon)  
- Cognitive subsystem specifications  
- Safety and governance guidelines  
- Experimental notes and design iterations  

Project Cortex is an open research effort toward interpretable, modular, and human-aligned AGI.

## Core Motivation

Modern AI systems demonstrate local competence but lack:

- Global executive control  
- Persistent memory and cognitive continuity  
- Multi-agent coordination  
- Reliable long-horizon planning  
- Internal arbitration and monitoring  
- Transparent reasoning pathways  
- Human-aligned constraints  

The human prefrontal cortex elegantly solves these challenges through hierarchical control, structured integration, value representation, conflict monitoring, and flexible decision making. **Project Cortex adapts these principles into a computational architecture for scalable general intelligence.**

## Key Architectural Components

### 1. Orchestrator (Executive Controller)
Inspired by the dorsolateral and frontopolar PFC, the Orchestrator governs:

- Task interpretation  
- Goal and subgoal decomposition  
- Cognitive sequencing  
- Integration of agent outputs  
- Long-horizon coherence  
- Memory-state management  
- Arbitration decisions  

### 2. Specialized Cognitive Agents
Each agent handles a dedicated cognitive domain:

- Reasoning Agent  
- Planning Agent  
- Risk Evaluation Agent  
- Memory Agent  
- Execution Agent  

### 3. Shared Memory System
A structured workspace containing:

- Working memory  
- Intermediate representations  
- Persistent knowledge  

### 4. Arbitration and Conflict Resolution
Inspired by ACC and OFC conflict-monitoring systems:

- Evaluates competing proposals  
- Ensures stability and safe decision making  
- Prevents cognitive drift  
- Requires human approval for high-risk outputs

Includes:

- Misuse detection  
- Internal Risk Agent  
- Human approval layers  
- Value anchoring  
- Intent analysis  
- Transparent audit logs  
- Controlled autonomy  

### Licensing  
Licensed under **Apache 2.0** with an additional **Responsible Use Policy**.

## Use Cases and Domains

Project Cortex can be applied to:

- Scientific research automation  
- Healthcare diagnostics and planning  
- Robotics and embodied intelligence  
- Autonomous software engineering  
- Enterprise decision systems  
- Cybersecurity and threat modeling  
- Education and personalized learning  
- Strategic simulations  

All real-world deployments must follow human-supervised workflows.

## Research Philosophy

Project Cortex is built on four pillars:

### 1. Neuroscience-Driven Design  
Using validated PFC cognitive principles to guide AGI architecture.

### 2. Modular Multi-Agent Intelligence  
Distributed agents coordinated by an executive Orchestrator.

### 3. Transparent Internal Structure  
Explicit reasoning, interpretable memory, and coherent policies.

### 4. Safety-Aligned Autonomy  
Auditable, predictable, and human-governed intelligence.
